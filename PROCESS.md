# Process Book

## day 1
* finished project proposal
* set up project in Xcode
* set up Google FireBase for user accounts

## day 2
* finished design document
* decided to create two keys in database: 'users' and 'houses'

## day 3
* decided to use Google Firebas Authetication, but not the database
  * database on local server (same as with Trivia Highscores)

## day 4
* finished prototype
* users can create a house with a password - other users can then select that house in a picker and join when password is correct
* added 'profile' tab
* remember user has logged in on device + possibility to log out

## day 5
* tried sample data on local server and Firebase, both worked to some extent

## day 6
* decided to not use Firebase database, but local server since data can be saved
* local database doens't yet allow for changing the data at a specific location, so I implemented things without working with actual data

## day 7
